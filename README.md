# -simple_calculator.py-
   Developed a simple calculator using Python that takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user. The program performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on the user's choice and displays the result. This project helped me understand basic input/output handling and conditional statements in Python.
